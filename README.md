## Julian Cabrera delivered a 1.5-hour Python Programming Lecture to 20 Junior Quant at the Traders@SMU Alpha Program 

Julian Cabrera, a Freshman at SMU, directs lectures and helps lead computer science education for Quant Finance cohorts at Traders@SMU, Southern Methodist University's Premier Quantitative Finance Program. On March 5th, he presented a 1.5-hour Python Basics for Quant Finance lecture to 20 students as part of the Traders@SMU Program. He started explaining basic computer science principles and then went straight into an Interactive Jupyter Notebook(Created by himself), with every student following along on their laptop, filling in the notebook. Going one step and concept at a time, he taught data types/collections, operations, control flow, functions & object-oriented programming with hands-on practice and challenges for the attending cohort. He then assigned a homework assignment with exercises that built on the concepts learned in the lesson. Julian is very ambitious about computer science and is passionate about explaining and teaching it to others. Julian created and assigned all the material in this Repository.
